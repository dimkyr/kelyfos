in the air can generally be divided into two categories — gasses/vapours and
particles. Particles include dust, pollen, dander, smoke, soot, mould spores,
viruses, bacteria and respiratory particles. Particles can be removed by using
a fan to pull air through a filter which collects the particles and allows the
particle-free clean air to pass through.</span></p>

filtration can happen in one of two places. Most buildings have a heating,
ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system. This is also called mechanical
ventilation. The units that supply air are called air handling units and in
addition to supplying outdoor air and heating or cooling the air, they also
have a filter. The air that is being supplied should have some outdoor air
mixed in, should be heated or cooled to be comfortable and should be filtered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Typical air
handling unit. Air returns from the space, either gets exhausted or
recirculated. Outdoor air gets mixed in. The air passes through a filter,
heating or cooling stages, a fan and then is supplied back to the space.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The other
way to filter the air is through a filtration unit in the space. It is a box
with a fan and a filter inside that pulls in air from the room, passes it
through a filter and supplies filtered air out. These units can be mounted on
the walls or ceiling, or they can be portable and left on the floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>1.
Efficiency — How well the filter can remove particles from the air (that’s what
the “E” stands for in HEPA and MERV). A more efficient filter can remove more
particles while a less efficient filter will let more pass through.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>2.
Pressure drop — How much the filter restricts the airflow. A high pressure drop
means there is a lot of restriction in the airflow and you need more powerful
fans to ensure proper airflow.</span></p>

clean the air. MERV-13 filters are less efficient than HEPA filters, but
ultimately you care about the clean air delivery rate = air flow x efficiency.
Classic CR boxes use box fans which have a much higher airflow than most
commercial HEPA filters, so the clean air delivery rate is still higher, even
after accounting for the reduced efficiency. They are also easy to assemble and
can be quickly deployed on a large scale. Newer style CR boxes use PC fans
which are super quiet and also have very high air flows when multiple fans are
used in parallel. They are more expensive and are currently more difficult to
build.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:8.4pt'><b><span lang=EN
style='font-size:17.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Advantages and
Disadvantages of Filtration</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In most
buildings, ventilation is the primary tool to clean indoor air. Although
filtration is not as commonly used, it has certain advantages over ventilation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ventilation
removes all indoor pollutants, but replaces them with outdoor pollutants,
although usually at much lower concentrations. Filtration only removes
particles from the air and does not have any possible adverse effects on air
quality. Filtration is much less energy intensive than ventilation, as ventilation
requires heating, cooling, humidifying or dehumidifying the outdoor air. Adding
portable HEPA filters or improving filtration in air handling units does not
require any structural changes to the building, while providing upgraded
ventilation might require significant changes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Filtration
has some disadvantages as well. It cannot remove gases or vapours and is only
effective against particulate matter. Unless well sealed, many filters have air
bypassing them which significantly reduces their efficiency. When used in an
air handling unit, filters can get loaded with dust and restrict airflow,
leading to detrimental effects on ventilation. This is a more significant
problem with high efficiency filters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>For
portable HEPA filters, the most significant issues are noise, air distribution
and human operation. Filters are often sized without considering noise level,
causing them to be run on lower speeds and be undersized for the space. Noise
should be considered when selecting HEPA filters with the best option often
being running multiple oversized HEPA filters on lower speeds. Recommendations
for portable air filters with noise considerations can be found here:&nbsp;<a
href="https://cleanairstars.com/filters">https://cleanairstars.com/</a></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Providing
clean air to the occupants of the room requires the clean air to be properly
distributed throughout the room. Air speeds from HEPA filters are generally
insufficient to allow the supplied air to mix well with the room. This can be
mitigated by using fans to mix the air or spacing out multiple portable HEPA
filters throughout the room. ASHRAE standard 62.1 states that if air is
supplied and returns on the same side of the room, you should only assume that
the air distribution is half as effective as if it were properly distributed
throughout the space with diffusers (See ASHRAE&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/standards-and-guidelines">62.1–2022&nbsp;</a>Table
6–4 and equation 6–2). This would apply to portable air cleaners as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Portable
air cleaners require occupants to operate them. If the person doesn’t care or
the noise is bothering them, they are likely to turn it off and it becomes
ineffective. For convenience, often they are placed in the corner and away from
the people which can exacerbate air distribution issues. To ensure portable air
cleaners are used properly, there should be follow up with the occupants of the
space and adjustments of equipment or strategies if the portable air cleaners
are not being used properly, but this is rarely done. It is for these reasons
that while portable air cleaners can be effective, they are not an ideal
long-term solution for indoor air quality improvement. A better alternative for
in-room filtration is to mount air cleaners on the walls or ceiling, design it to
have the proper clean air delivery rate and noise levels, remove occupant
control and ensure the air is properly distributed.</span></p>
